I Still Prefer Print
====================

December 29, 2010

I'm an unabashed fan of ebooks, especially when they come at a price point significantly lower than a print book. Combined with surprisingly good file format conversion applications like Calibre, I find the ease and ubiquity of an ebook hard to beat; between my Kindle and Dropbox, I always have something on hand to read.

And yet I still prefer print. There's something alluring about the the tactile feedback as pages are turned. Moreover, studying from a print text is still unparalleled. Easily flipping back between pages and sections, custom markup - underlining, bracketing, margin notes, stars - and the occasional sticky note for longer notes and page marking can't be beat. For all that I'm more than willing to lug a thousand-page tome around wherever I go.
