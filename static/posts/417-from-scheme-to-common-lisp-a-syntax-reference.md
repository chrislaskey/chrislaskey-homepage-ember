From Scheme to Common Lisp, A Syntax Reference
==============================================

November 17, 2011

Lisp is quite common in Computer Science. As a nearly "syntax free" language, it is an excellent language for explaining computational concepts. Although it is quite common to see the Lisp dialect Scheme (or a equally trimmed down pseudo-lisp) used, there are some great texts written in Common Lisp, a few still in Emacs Lisp, and increasingly more in Clojure.

Since the goal of these texts is to be illustrative of concepts, not vocational in teaching a particular dialect, even small pieces of time spent deciphering syntax differences is wasteful. The best resource I've found for the fellow academic minded lispers out there is the [Hyperpolyglot Lisp reference table](http://hyperpolyglot.org/lisp).

As someone who learned Scheme in [The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992) and continues to use it while working through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871) and [The Seasoned Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/Seasoned-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/026256100X) I've found the [Hyperpolyglot reference table](http://hyperpolyglot.org/lisp) to be very helpful while stepping out of Scheme and into papers written in other dialects, like many of [Paul Graham's](http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html) that use Common Lisp.

At the end of the day its the concepts that matter, and any tool that can cut down on distractions like syntax, is well worth it.
