Learning Without Hubris
=======================

July 27, 2010

My best advice is to constantly learn and do it without hubris. I firmly believe the only way to improve is to constantly identify weaknesses and face them headfirst. Just this morning I googled "What is Network Address Translation (NAT)". By all accounts NAT is something I should know by now. I could have come up with a variety of excuses and reasons for why I don't know it and why it's not worth my time. But I didn't. Once I identified the weakness I addressed it.

Don't ever let your pride stop you from admitting your weaknesses however large or small. We all have them. What matters is what you do personally to address it.
